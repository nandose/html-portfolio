<h3>The Pope's Exorcist</h3>
<p>
  Very well written movie, had the perfect blend of suspense, humour, thriller
  and action! The cast was also flawless... Definitely one of my best movies so
  far!
</p>
<h3>Chavalier</h3>
<p>
  This movie hit so many chords. It was straight fire from the first scene...
  The music was intense, as well as the romance, love and all the sadness. An
  all round awesome movie.
</p>
<h3>Real Steel</h3>
<p>
  Started slow and was a bit discouraging, but kept it going as Hugh Jackman was
  in the cast, and boy was I in for a ride. Easily one of my best action movies.
